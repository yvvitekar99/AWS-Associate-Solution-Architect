# AWS IAM Policies Hands-On Summary

## Demonstration Overview
Shows how IAM policies work in practice by adding/removing permissions and observing the effects.

## Key Demonstrations

### 1. Permission Removal Test
- **Action**: Removed user "Stephane" from admin group
- **Result**: Lost access to view users (AccessDenied for `iam:ListUsers`)
- **Learning**: Group membership directly affects permissions

### 2. Direct Policy Attachment
- **Action**: Attached `IAMReadOnlyAccess` policy directly to user
- **Result**: Could view users/groups but couldn't create them
- **Learning**: Read-only vs full access permissions

### 3. Multiple Permission Sources
Final user "Stephane" had 3 permission sources:
- **AdministratorAccess** (from admin group)
- **AlexaForBusiness** (from developers group)  
- **IAMReadOnlyAccess** (attached directly)

## Policy Analysis

### AdministratorAccess Policy
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "*",
  "Resource": "*"
}
```
- **Meaning**: Allow ANY action on ANY resource

### IAMReadOnlyAccess Policy
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow", 
  "Action": [
    "iam:Get*",
    "iam:List*"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```
- **Meaning**: Allow only Get/List operations on IAM resources

## Policy Creation Tools

### Visual Editor
- Select service (e.g., IAM)
- Choose specific actions (e.g., ListUsers, GetUser)
- Define resources (all or specific)

### JSON Editor  
- Direct JSON policy creation
- More control and flexibility

## Key Takeaways
- **Inheritance**: Users inherit all permissions from their groups
- **Direct Attachment**: Policies can be attached directly to users
- **Wildcards**: `*` means "everything" in AWS policies
- **Least Privilege**: Give only the minimum permissions needed
