# AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) - Deep Dive Summary

## What is IAM?

**IAM** stands for **Identity and Access Management**. It's a **global AWS service** that helps you manage who can access your AWS resources and what they can do with them.

## Key Components

### 1. Root Account
- **What it is**: The master account created when you first sign up for AWS
- **Important**: Only use it for initial account setup
- **Best Practice**: Don't use it for daily operations or share it with others

### 2. Users
- **Definition**: Each user represents **one person** in your organization
- **Purpose**: Individual accounts for people who need AWS access
- **Examples**: Alice, Bob, Charles, David, Edward, Fred

### 3. Groups
- **Definition**: Collections of users with similar roles or responsibilities
- **Rules**:
  - Groups can **only contain users** (not other groups)
  - Users **don't have to** belong to a group (though it's not best practice)
  - Users **can belong to multiple groups**

## Example Organization Structure

```
Organization (6 people):
├── Developers Group
│   ├── Alice
│   ├── Bob
│   └── Charles
├── Operations Group
│   ├── David
│   └── Edward
├── Audit Team Group (additional group)
│   ├── Charles (also in Developers)
│   └── David (also in Operations)
└── Fred (no group - not recommended)
```

## IAM Policies

### What are Policies?
- **JSON documents** that define permissions
- Written in plain English-like syntax
- Specify **what actions** users/groups can perform
- Specify **which AWS services** they can access

### Example Policy Structure
```json
{
  "Allow": [
    "EC2: describe",
    "Elastic Load Balancing: describe", 
    "CloudWatch: access"
  ]
}
```

## Security Principle

### Least Privilege Principle
- **Rule**: Don't give more permissions than a user actually needs
- **Why**: 
  - Prevents accidental costly resource launches
  - Maintains security
  - Reduces risk of unauthorized access

### Example
If a user only needs access to 3 specific services, create permissions for exactly those 3 services - nothing more.

## Key Takeaways

1. **IAM is global** - works across all AWS regions
2. **Create individual users** for each person in your organization
3. **Use groups** to organize users with similar roles
4. **Apply policies** to control what users can do
5. **Follow least privilege** - minimal necessary permissions only
6. **Avoid using root account** for daily operations

## Best Practices Summary

✅ **Do:**
- Create individual IAM users for each person
- Group users by role/department
- Apply least privilege principle
- Use policies to control access

❌ **Don't:**
- Use root account for daily operations
- Give excessive permissions
- Leave users without proper grouping
- Share account credentials
